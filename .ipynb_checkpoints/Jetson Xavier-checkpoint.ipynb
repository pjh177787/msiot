    "## Setup Xavier\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, you need a Ubuntu machine.\n",
    "    - See section 'Our Ubuntu machine'\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install Jetpack with SDKmanager. Note that you would need an NVIDIA account in order to download and use SDKmanager.\n",
    "    - [Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager)\n",
    "    - [Document](https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/index.html)\n",
    "    - Installation instructions are at the bottom of the first link.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You need a USB cable to connect Jetson with the host Ubuntu computer. \n",
    "    - According to the document, you need to use the front USB-C port.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Connect the Ethernet cable for connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect a screen with the HDMI port at the back. You may also connect a pair of mouse and keyboard to Xavier with a hub and hook it up to the back of Xavier.\n",
    "    - This is highly recommended. You will very likely need these.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Up until this point, your Xavier isn't powered on. Now you need to put your Xavier into recovery mode.\n",
    "    - Hold down recover button. Don't release.\n",
    "        - It's the one in the middle. You should see small prints that say 'force recovery' next to the button.\n",
    "    - Hold down power button. Don't release.\n",
    "        - It's the one closer to the front. You should see a small print that says 'power' next to the button.\n",
    "    - Release both buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the installer (SDKmanager).\n",
    "    - After the OS is flashed, you need to go to the Xavier screen and finish the setup. \n",

    "### Caution!\n",
    "When updating system packages with ```apt update && apt upgrade```, take extra care with nvidia packages. **DO NOT** update nvidia drivers or cudnn packages unless you know what you are doing. If for some reason CUDA is not working properly, you should be able to fallback to the CUDA 10.0 by running the ```~/msiot/install_cuda.sh``` script with super user priviledge."
